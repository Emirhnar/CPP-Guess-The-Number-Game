# Guess The Number Game

This program is a simple "Guess The Number" game where the user selects a number between 1 and 100 and compares it with a randomly generated number by the computer.

## How it works?

- The user is asked to enter a number between 1 and 100.
- If the entered number is invalid (not between 1-100), the user is prompted again until a valid number is entered.
- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user's number is compared with the random number.
- If the numbers match, the user is congratulated.
- If not, the user is informed that the guess is wrong.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (g++, or any other compiler)

## How to run the program

```bash
g++ sayitahminoyunu.cpp -o sayitahminoyunu
./sayitahminoyunu
